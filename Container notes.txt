Questions:
	- What is the hostname or  host exactly in Linux context
	- why we can't set the hostname before?
	- How namespaces works
	- How cgroup works
	- When os.getpid() returns child process id then how is cgroup.procs have pid from kernel's perspective

How actual docker works:
	- Docker Daemon is the docker management tool that actually creates and runs these containers

To do:
	- update so that copy directories commands runs only once
	- Test the container project for proper resource management using cgroups
	- Provide functionality to configure cgroups
	- Add virtual networks
	

Steps to run a container using this go program:
	1: Run these commands in the Linux terminal to copy all the important files from original root to current root
		mkdir -p /mnt/c/Projects/Containers/rootfs
		rsync -av /bin /mnt/c/Projects/Containers/rootfs
		rsync -av /lib /mnt/c/Projects/Containers/rootfs
		rsync -av /lib64 /mnt/c/Projects/Containers/rootfs
		rsync -av /usr/bin /mnt/c/Projects/Containers/rootfs
		rsync -av /usr/lib /mnt/c/Projects/Containers/rootfs
		rsync -av /usr/lib64 /mnt/c/Projects/Containers/rootfs
		rsync -av /etc /mnt/c/Projects/Containers/rootfs
	
	2: Create folders proc and sys under tootfs. These folders creation part should be included in the go program in future
	3: Run the main.go
